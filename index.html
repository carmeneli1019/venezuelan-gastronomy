      The gastronomy of Venezuela is characterized by having intense flavors and being very visually attractive. Throughout history it has incorporated both traditional indigenous cuisine and influences from European countries such as Spain, Italy and France. However, there are predominant basic ingredients, such as corn, tubers, grains, meat and poultry.

      As in every culture, talking about Venezuelan gastronomy is taking a trip throughout the country, and since Venezuelans usually celebrate special events with good food and family dishes, it is also a nostalgic trip for those who have ever had contact with this culture.
      
      Due to the high Venezuelan migration in recent years, the influence of the country's typical gastronomy has been spreading, overcoming geographical and linguistic barriers, so that more and more, the Venezuelan flavor is conquering more corners of the world.
      
      Since the list of delicious dishes and drinks is so extensive, in this article we are going to mention the most traditional and popular ones. And we will also talk a little bit about some restaurants in certain parts of the world (outside of Venezuela) where you can also try a little bit of the Venezuelan flavor!

          <h2>Arepa</h2>
          <p>The arepa is the most typical Venezuelan dish. It's made from ground dry corn or precooked corn flour. It is consumed throughout the country, usually eaten almost every day, filled, for breakfast or dinner as a main dish or as a side dish. Since it has a neutral flavor, it's the most versatile dish! Can be eaten with almost anything, cheese, black beans, chicken and avocado, shredded beef, tuna, you name it! </p>

          <h2>Cachapa</h2>
          <p>It is a dish similar to a pancake, more sweet than the arepa, and it incorporates grains of baby corn or corn flour. The most common way to eat it is to fill it with "queso de mano", or "queso guayanés" and add a little bit of butter, these are typical Venezuelan cheeses more salty in flavor, so the contrast between the sweet cachapa and the salty cheese goes really well.</p>

        <h2>Hallaca</h2>
        <p>The "Hallaquita" is a precooked corn or jojoto (corn) dough wrapped in corn or banana leaves, which is sometimes mixed with chicharrones or pork or beef. They are generally eaten with grilled chicken or grilled meat. This masterpiece of our cuisine is the most traditional of the dishes that decorate the Christmas festivities in our Venezuela. Given the process to make hallacas is so long, the tradition is to make them with the whole family, so making them is a happy excuse to spend time with your loved ones during the festivities!</p>

        <h2>Pabellón</h2>
        <p> One of the most complete and traditional dishes of the Venezuelan Cuisine. The traditional pavilion is made up of cooked white rice, shredded meat, black beans and slices of fried ripe plantain. The history of the pavilion dates back to colonial times, and according to what is said, it is basically a gathering of "leftovers" from previous meals carried out by the slaves of the haciendas.          
          Reference is usually made to the fact that the dish represents the three great Venezuelan cultures: European (white: rice), indigenous (brown: meat) and African (black: beans). However, this statement is merely poetic.</p>

      <h2>Marquesa de Chocolate</h2>
      <p>The Chocolate marquise is a typical Venezuelan dessert, although it does not belong to the classic recipes of our grandmothers' stove. It is a combination of layers of Maria Cookies and layers of chocolate pudding, however simple in ingredientes and easy to make (it doesn't even require to have an oven!), it has a very nice finish, as when you cut it, you can see the alternate layers. And let's be honest, who doesn't love a good chocolate cake? </p>

      <h2>Chicha</h2>
      <p>The "Chicha criolla" is a sweet non-alcoholic drink made from rice or wheat semolina -mainly- and cow's milk, to which condensed milk, cinnamon or chocolate chips are usually added It is a very thick drink that it is taken cold with ice, going very well with the hot weather that we have in Venezuela (it's practically summer all year long!)

        It is a very traditional drink, usually sold by vendors on the streets called "chicheros." It is even sold pasteurized with presentations similar to those of juices, milks and industrial shakes. </p>
